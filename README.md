## Objetive ##

The main objective of this project is to try to predict the price that a taxi will cost us in Chicago based on the data of other journeys made in this city and adding information about the weather. 

The **scope of the project** is to provide knowledge about a big data set from a short period of time. By applying the same 
analysis over historical data before the regulation, may provide useful insights to solve business issues. 

## About the methodology ##
The CRISP-DM (*cross-industry process for data mining*) methodology provides a structured approach to planning a data mining task and was applied to this data science project.
